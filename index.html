      <b>Beadwork</b> is the art or craft of attaching "
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bead">beads</a> to one another by
      stringing them with a sewing needle or beading needle and thread or thin
      wire, or sewing them to cloth.Beads come in a variety of materials, shapes
      and sizes. Beads are used to create jewelry or other articles of personal
      adornment; they are also used in wall hangings and sculpture and many
      other artworks. Beadwork techniques are broadly divided into loom and
      off-loom weaving, stringing, bead embroidery, bead crochet, bead knitting,
      and bead tatting.

      I have always been very interested in arts.It was my mother who introduced
      me to embroidery when I was around 12-13 years old. I developed keen
      interest in embroidery . It was very basic like cross stitch and
      embroidery on

      But I never actually got much time to do what I loved, but I came back to
      the art every now and then.

      Few years back,while browsing through the internet I came across beaded
      jewelry and immediately got hooked to it. And why not? The things you can
      make with beads are endless.<br />

      There are a zillion different bead stitches, braids, weaves, etc. It
      simply never gets boring because I can always try something new. Plus,
      people are always inventing new wires, tools and beads. Sometimes old
      tools are introduced into the industry and used in new and interesting
      ways.I also feel like beading interconnects us worldwide. You’d be hard
      pressed to find a culture that doesn’t use beads in some way. You can make
      all kinds of jewlery using beads, however I love tyo make earrrings , as I
      love earrings.

      <p><b>Bead weaving</b> is a beadwork technique in which seed beads are woven together using thread to create a flat "fabric" or a
      three-dimensional shape such as a ball, clasp or tube. You can bead weave an entire piece of jewelry, or weave a
      component to use as part of a project.</p>

      Beads are used not just to make jewelry but also to make beautiful flowers, figures and other 3-D forms.French Beading is an art many centuries old.The term French Beading refers to a specific set of techniques used with tiny glass seed beads strung on wire to make flowers (and sometimes other objects). Essentially, French Beading is wire wrapping with beads. Each flower can take hours or days to complete, while full arrangements can take months.But not all bead-and-wire flowers are French Beaded. There is also the Victorian Method (also called Continental Method) which is often confused with French Beading. How do you tell them apart? The Victorian technique involves crossing two wires through a single row of beads, while in French Beading the wire will usually pass through beads just once.
